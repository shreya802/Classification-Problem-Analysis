# Classification-system
This repository contains exploratory data analysis on Income Classification problem and build classifier system using Logistic Regression technique.

**Problem Statement**:
Subsidy Inc. is company which delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income.Classify the income level based on attributes we have for individual level.
subsidy inc. wishes us to: Develop an income clssifier system for individuals.
Simplify the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studied, without sacrificing too much of accuracy. Such a system would help subsidy inc. in planning subsidy outlay, monitoring and preventing misuse.

This is a simple binary classification problem which use logistic regression technique. Using logistic regression we will build a classify model based on available data.
